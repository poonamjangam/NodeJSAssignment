CRUD API in Node JS, Express JS, and Mongo DB.

Hi Everyone,

This is my first project in Node JS with Mongo DB - From this project, you will be able to perform basic CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) API Operations in Mongo DB using POSTMAN.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Install below listed necessary packages using npm command for your project: "body-parser": "^1.19.0","dotenv": "^10.0.0","express": "^4.17.1","mongoose":"^5.12.11","nodemon":"^2.0.7"

Install Visual Studio Code for better handling and working on the files with helpful extensions like console,gitbash etc. Install Postman to send CRUD requests and get a response for the same.
